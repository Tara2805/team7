      <img src="Austaralia2.png" alt="imgaus" />

      <p class="my-3 mx-3">
        Australia, the smallest continent and one of the largest countries on
        Earth, lying between the Pacific and Indian oceans in the Southern
        Hemisphere. Australia's capital is Canberra, located in the southeast
        between the larger and more important economic and cultural centres of
        Sydney and Melbourne. The Australian mainland extends from west to east
        for nearly 2,500 miles (4,000 km) and from Cape York Peninsula in the
        northeast to Wilsons Promontory in the southeast for nearly 2,000 miles
        (3,200 km). To the south, Australian jurisdiction extends a further 310
        miles (500 km) to the southern extremity of the island of Tasmania, and
        in the north it extends to the southern shores of Papua New Guinea.
        Australia is separated from Indonesia to the northwest by the Timor and
        Arafura seas, from Papua New Guinea to the northeast by the Coral Sea
        and the Torres Strait, from the Coral Sea Islands Territory by the Great
        Barrier Reef, from New Zealand to the southeast by the Tasman Sea, and
        from Antarctica in the far south by the Indian Ocean.

      <h2>Canada</h2>
      <img src="Canada2.png" alt="imgcanada" />

      <p class="my-3 mx-3">
        Canada, the second largest country in the world in area (after Russia),
        occupying roughly the northern two-fifths of the continent of North
        America. Despite Canada's great size, it is one of the world's most
        sparsely populated countries. This fact, coupled with the grandeur of
        the landscape, has been central to the sense of Canadian national
        identity, as expressed by the Dublin-born writer Anna Brownell Jameson,
        who explored central Ontario in 1837 and remarked exultantly on “the
        seemingly interminable line of trees before you; the boundless
        wilderness around you; the mysterious depths amid the multitudinous
        foliage, where foot of man hath never penetrated…the solitude in which
        we proceeded mile after mile, no human being, no human dwelling within
        sight.” Although Canadians are comparatively few in number, they have
        crafted what many observers consider to be a model multicultural
        society, welcoming immigrant populations from every other continent. In
        addition, Canada harbours and exports a wealth of natural resources and
        intellectual capital equaled by few other countries.

      <h2><b>USA</b></h2>
      <img src="USA2.png" alt="imgusa" />

      <p class="my-3 mx-3">
        States, country in North America, a federal republic of 50 states.
        Besides the 48 conterminous states that occupy the middle latitudes of
        the continent, the United States includes the state of Alaska, at the
        northwestern extreme of North America, and the island state of Hawaii,
        in the mid-Pacific Ocean. The conterminous states are bounded on the
        north by Canada, on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south by the
        Gulf of Mexico and Mexico, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean. The
        United States is the fourth largest country in the world in area (after
        Russia, Canada, and China). The national capital is Washington, which is
        coextensive with the District of Columbia, the federal capital region
        created in 1790. The major characteristic of the United States is
        probably its great variety. Its physical environment ranges from the
        Arctic to the subtropical, from the moist rain forest to the arid
        desert, from the rugged mountain peak to the flat prairie. Although the
        total population of the United States is large by world standards, its
        overall population density is relatively low. The country embraces some
        of the world's largest urban concentrations as well as some of the most
        extensive areas that are almost devoid of habitation.
